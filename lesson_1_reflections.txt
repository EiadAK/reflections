was introduced?

By knowing the changes that maybe it's the reason of the bug

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

I think that creating a commit manually more efficient
because by that you can decide what important change that need to make a point after it

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

I think it's depend on the needs of each system
whereas Git work's with programming projects which need a multiple files
while Google Docs work's with documents which it's not related

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

We write the command git log to see all the commits in our project 
then we use the command git diff to compare the different between the files in two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

Because by using a version control it's easy to recover the bugs even after a huge change
and that's will done by compare the first commit id with the bug 
with the last commit id without it

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

For learning and making projects
