When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If I want to work with a team on the same project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date
with your remote repository?
I think that if I am not certain yet on some changes I've made 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
I think that I can said that the forks like's the branches but it's from a project in the GitHub 
clones simply it's a clone from a project to our local device
branches it's a branch from commits master line 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It's useful to make our work starting from the last state of the project which our partners work on it

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
