What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
There is a new hidden directory has been added. 
And I think we need to do it to initialize a place to our old files before every commit  

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It's a place between the working directory and the repository
we can by it chose the files which will do a commit for it
And it's help our commits to be more specialist
